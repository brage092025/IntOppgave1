# GENERICS IMPLEMENTATION

My first program using generics, which I'm still trying to wrap my head around how works.

## Thoughts

I think a good expansion on this would be to add functionality to add more drinktypes and it could potentially be expanded to be used as a basis for POS bar system. With adding stock volumes, serving sizes, unitprice, servingprices etc.
